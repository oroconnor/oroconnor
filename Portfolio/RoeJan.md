## Roe Jan Watershed Community

I did contract work for this [watershed community group](https://www.roejanwatershed.org) through the Bard Center for Environmental Sciences and Humanities. 

- Cleaned and organized past monitoring data.
- Rebuilt Shiny App that allowed exploration of the water quality data, including calculation and interpretation of water bacteria advisory levels.
