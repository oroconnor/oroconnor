## Soil Flux Analysis

Cornell Cooperative Extension had been conducting this study of greenhouse gas flux in agricultural soils, in collaboration with the Carey Institute of Ecosystem Studies. They contracted with me to do data processing and analysis in preparation for an annual report on the study. 

In addition to doing the data analysis with R scripts, I created visualizations for [their report](https://github.com/oroconnor/RShiny_and_other_Visuals/blob/main/Charts/2020%20Annual%20Report%20HVFH%20GHG%20Trial%20FINAL.pdf), based on Cornell Cooperative Extension's requirements.
