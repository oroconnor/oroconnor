## Dry Bean Classification

This may not be the most exciting project of all time, but I include it here because it's a clean example of a "meat and potatoes" machine learning classification project using a Python notebook. 

My partner and I used Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classification methods to classify drybeans by variety using a dataset of their physical characteristics. 

You can see the [full repo here.](https://github.com/oroconnor/CS345-Project/tree/main) However, I would recommend downloading the [html file](https://github.com/oroconnor/CS345-Project/blob/main/finalreport.html) of our final report, and opening it in a browser so you can see the charts rendered.
