## Bard Center For Environmental Science and Humanities

I started off doing volunteer work with this lab at Bard College, which does community centered air and water monitoring, and later did contract consulting work for various projects that required R programming and data manipulation. 

- Organized, cleaned and consolidated decades of Sawkill watershed water quality monitoring data that had been collected with various formats and protocols. Worked with lab technicians to figure out meta data for past monitoring projects. Delivered R scripts for processing raw data files and for formatting and appending new data to the full set.
- Built a Shiny App so that stream water quality data could be explored and filtered.

- Provided [R notebook](https://github.com/oroconnor/AirReport) with analysis for multiyear reporting on a community air quality monitoring project.
- Created a Shiny App that pulled in "live" air quality data via sensor APIs and provided interpretation, as well as allowed for exploration of historic data.
