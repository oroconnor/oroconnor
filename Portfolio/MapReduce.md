## National Estuarine Reserve Big Data Project

This was a group project for a Big Data class, where the requirements included processing a dataset of a certain minimum size, and using a framework such as MapReduce or Spark to handle the data.

Our team pulled in water quality and meteorlogical data from the National Estuarine Reserve, attempted to join the water and air temperature data, and then did Mann Kendall tests for characterizing temperature trends. 

You can see the [full Repo here.](https://github.com/oroconnor/cs435finalproject) I think that there were a variety of flaws in our approach, but it was interesting to dive deeper into the specifics of the Mann Kendall tests, and incorporate seasonality into the analysis. It was also satisfying to get experience processing data on a distributed system that can handle larger datasets.
