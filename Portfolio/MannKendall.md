## Mann Kendall Java Program

This is a [simple Java program](https://github.com/oroconnor/StreamJava/tree/main) that I made for an open ended school assignment. It allows the user to upload a CSV file with water data and get trend summary statistics using the Mann Kendall trends test. 

This program doesn't use any seasonal adjustments to the trends test, but the project allowed me to think more about the mechanics of the Mann Kendall test by building the pieces for the analysis in Java rather than just using an R package. I carried this interest in a more involved ["big data" project](https://github.com/oroconnor/oroconnor/blob/main/Portfolio/MapReduce.md) later in my college studies.
