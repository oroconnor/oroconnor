## Sawkill Watershed Community

In addition to their water quality work, the [Sawkill Watershed Community](https://sawkillwatershed.org) had been monitoring amphibian crossings for many years. They contracted with me to use R to consolidate the data from many spreadsheets and provide summaries and custom data visualizations.
